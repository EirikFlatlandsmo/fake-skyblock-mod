# Notes

The dupe mod loads a jar called fabric-mixins.jar which is located inside the resource folder.

Fabric-mixins.jar loads a very long string from the "icon.png" file. I then decrypted that string (stage1.txt), which led me to stage2.txt, which is a obfuscated powershell script.

The channel has a lot of attention. One video has 60k views, which is concerning.

Thanks to firefish111 for decoding the main payload
